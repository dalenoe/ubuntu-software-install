# Ubuntu Software Installer

Written By: Dale Noe (dalenoe@gmail.com)

This script was written for Ubuntu, but should work fine on Debian as well. It could also be
modified for other Linux flavors.

This script will update the software repository, before installing the packages of your choice.

## Features

It will install different types of software. Right now there is 6 things it can install.

htop  
nmap  
bmon  
lamp-server - LAMP Stack  
postgresql  
whois  
nagios3  

Want to see something added? Open a issue on the gitlab project page. Some of this
software might already be installed on your system by default. The next version will
make sure it's not installing stuff that is there by default.
