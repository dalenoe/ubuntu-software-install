# Ubuntu Software Installer

## Written By: Dale Noe (dalenoe@gmail.com)

This script was written for Ubuntu, but should work fine on Debian as well. It could also be
modified for other Linux flavors.

This script will update the software repository, before installing the packages of your choice.

Want to see additional packages? Open a issue and we will get the package added if possible.

Right now the script is only setup to install software already in the repository.
It won't update your sources.list at this time.
